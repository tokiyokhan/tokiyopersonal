	<h3>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science( General Computing)</h3>
	<p>(old name of degree was BCS (Hons.) changed to BS (CS) according to UGC recommendation)
Duration: 4 years Degree Program (8 Semesters).
Minimum 2nd division in F.Sc. Pre-Engineering, Pre-Medical (with one deficiency Math subject) , Intermediate in General Science, Computer Science

This four-year degree program provides challenging, in-depth study in the areas that form the basis of computer technology, namely computer programming and computer systems. This program assures that the graduates are adequately prepared to enter and continue to practice in the field of computer science. The program provides a sufficiently broad base of mathematics, physical science, engineering science, computer experience, laboratory experience, and design experience in order that the students can learn to apply the fundamentals of computer science principles in a reasonable and efficient manner.  The students are encouraged to design, develop, debug and test software and hardware for computer systems, embedded systems, network systems, and electronic equipments.</p>
